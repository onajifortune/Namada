  "details": "This proposal reduces staking inflation from 5% to 2.75% and lowers the target staking ratio from 55% to 45%. The goal is to eliminate unnecessary dilution now that security thresholds are met, while freeing issuance to incentivize privacy usage through Shielded Rewards. By rebalancing inflation toward real adoption, this change reduces wasteful issuance and strengthens the long-term sustainability of the network.\n\nThe file used to produce the attached wasm can be found here: https://github.com/namada-net/namada-governance-upgrades/blob/9ea5c5a6d8d29a2866e83f73ece069d4658cd822/increase_target_staked_ratio/src/lib.rs",
