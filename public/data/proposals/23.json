Currently, these claims enter a code path that iterates asymptotically and does not complete before the tx times out.\n\nThe code used to generate the WASM attached to this proposal can be found here: https://github.com/anoma/namada-governance-upgrades/blob/6da3b4b1835ae531589bcef65602bf3a803e1de3/update-tx-claim-rewards-2/src/lib.rs.\n\nPlease see the forum discussion linked here for more details.",
