  "details": "This proposal is a follow-up to the failed Proposal #22, which was voted down due to concerns about the values in storage for certain `precision` keys and their associated MASP data. This proposal updates these values to more safely ensure that shielded inflation is actually minted once enabled, given arbitrary amounts of tokens in the shielded pool.\n\nThe code used to generate the WASM attached to this proposal can be found here: https://github.com/anoma/namada-governance-upgrades/blob/374a2a919e4119f2cb99e417926a3ef2bb3c8ea4/pre-phase4/src/lib.rs.\n\nSee the forum discussion for more details.",
