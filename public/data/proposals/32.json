  "details": "This proposal updates the Multi-Asset Shielded Pool incentive mechanism by recalibrating the Proportional Gain (p_gain_nom) and Derivative Gain (d_gain_nom) values for incentivized assets. These changes aim to ensure that shielded pool rewards respond more predictably, correcting cases where adjustments were too slow or too fast.\n\nIn addition, we propose reducing Shielded Set Reward (SSR) targets across assets to better align inflation incentives with observed usage and privacy needs. This calibration narrows the scope of incentives to the most active pools while reducing inflation costs on underutilized assets.\n\nThe file used to produce the attached wasm can be found here: https://github.com/namada-net/namada-governance-upgrades/blob/5fad42152f631607a7763352f230040629f7d3e4/phase4/src/lib.rs",
