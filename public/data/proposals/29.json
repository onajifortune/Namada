  "created": "2025-07-25T23:51:00.000Z",
  "details": "This is a Continuous Public Goods Funding (cPGF) proposal to use ~0.67% of the annual PGF budget to allocate NAM to the current active set of Namada validators for year. If approved, **every epoch, 30.1369863 NAM** will be allocated to each tnam address of the **166 active validators**. Assuming this set of cPGF token \"streams\" will end in one year, the **total amount of NAM per validator will be 44,000 NAM**.\n\n#### Notes\n1. While this is part of the PGF budget, the PGF budget does not inflate the NAM supply until it is allocated. If approved, this will introduce 0.67% supply inflation over the year.\n2. There is [not yet a built-in way to end cPGF](https://github.com/namada-net/namada/issues/4104), so a follow-up PGF proposal will be needed to stop this cPGF after one year; exact date to be determined at proposal launch.\n\n#### Recipient List\nhttps://github.com/Luminara-Hub/govproposals/commit/9f2f88579aa96572e5414b560cb1e96a92eb9169\n\n(Github because the list exceeds governance proposal limit) \n\n#### Exclusions\n- Unit 410 [2]\ttnam1q9vnysn3jj9l3rnucr0zt4jpuy224wdl7c0gezrj\n- Shutdown 1st july â€” Please Redelegate\ttnam1qyj7mwkpc9tg4mljg76wxshwq2rxlskx7c0tlx4c\n- ValidityOps#2\ttnam1q98jzz306gldxvtg5quwnej4zvna6pgnquk2t4dc\n- [ZKV](https://x.com/zkv_xyz/status/1943628922362503411)\ttnam1qxr8n7u36jcf82d0ccp0flshpwhz3d3xjv5ryn44\n- EquinoxDao (jailed > 10 days)\ttnam1q9zemh43mx2dwtlsrfgjanzzut3j5lepaq7uacug\n- Infraspear (jailed > 10 days)\ttnam1qx03fx58wtm6e2g5yt4uu9jpy702h4pjuy9a7653\n\n\n## Context\nMost staking inflation (~95%) goes to passive delegators, versus active validators with immediate operating costs.\n\nWe have a relatively large, diverse set of validators. Namada doesn't need to ensure a particularly large set of validators, but it would be helpful to have more time to continue to enable, surface and reward high-value-add validators so that they remain active. \n\nDirect support is a much more capital-efficient way to increase validator operator runway than by increasing staking inflation. The goal is to extend operator runway to sustain diversity in preparation for a more targeted, meritocratic rewards model.\n\n## Future\nIf this proposal passes, there should be a proposal to end this subsidy after one year (Luminara intends to do this). There may also be intermediary proposal(s) to remove subsidies from inactive validators.\n\nAs a community, Namada should always be improving our collective ability to effectively target and reward active, value-add participants to sustain Namada's roadmap and mission-momentum.",
