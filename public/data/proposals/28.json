  "details": "This proposal is to enable shielding rewards for an initial set of seven assets: Cosmos Hub (ATOM), Osmosis (OSMO), Celestia (TIA), the Stride liquid-staked versions of these tokens, and Nobleâ€™s USDC. Alongside this activation, it will set initial starting points for several key configurable parameters, including the maximum inflation rate, token deposit targets, Proportional Gain, and Derivative Gain.\n\nIt should be clearly noted that these values are just initial settings, and they are fully configurable. The community can revisit and adjust these parameters through governance at any point in the future as needed.",
